version 1.0.0
-- Initial release.
-- Can create and unlock Cryfs Volumes.
-- Can create and unlock Encfs Volumes.
-- Can create and unlock Gocryptfs Volumes.
-- Can create and unlock Securefs Volumes.
-- Can save and retrieve volumes keys from KDE wallet,GNOME's libsecret and an internal
   secured storage system backed by libgcrypt.
-- Can save favorite volumes for easier access to frequently used volumes.
-- Can use keys derived from passphrases,keyfiles and a combination of a passphrase and a keyfile.
-- Can be build with Qt4(default) or with Qt5.
-- Can measure password strength when creating a new volume.
   The support is added using libpwquality project: https://fedorahosted.org/libpwquality/

-- Add ability to unmount all volumes at the same time(Menu->UnmountAll)
-- Add ability to generate mounting dialog with a single action(Menu->Favorites->Mount All)

-- Add French translations.

-- Add ability to auto unlock a volume from CLI.An example of how to do this is:

   sirikali -d /home/mtz/cryfs.volume -b "internal"

   The "-b" option gives a passphrase storage backend to use to retrieve the password to unlock
   the volume. Currently,only 3 backends are supported:
   1. "internal" backend is always there and its backed by libgcrypt.
   2. "kwallet" is backed by KDE wallet is a compile time dependency of the project.
   3. "gnomewallet" is backed by GNOME's libsecret and is a compile time dependency of the project.

   Set the backend to use a blank passphrase(not recommended) if you want to be able to unlock
   your volumes without being prompt for a backend password.

-- Add support for unlocking volumes using an external config file.
-- Add a GUI ability to show cryfs file system space utilization.
-- Add a menu entry to set default mount point path prefix.
-- Add a convenient "HMAC+KeyFile" option to use a keyfile with an empty passphrase
   as a volume password. "Key+KeyFile" option is to be used if volume passphrase is to be a combination
   of a password and a keyfile. Both of these two options are better than using a "KeyFile" option
   because keyfiles will most likely be trancated on the first new line character encountered and al the
   contents of the keyfile may not be used leading to weak passphrase.

version 1.1.0
-- Add ability to automount favorites volumes on program start up time.
-- Add ability to automount favorites volumes when they become available ie,when the files systems the volume
   resides in is mounted.

version 1.2.0
-- Add ability to add a favorite volume with mount options(external config file path,idle timeout,auto mount).
-- Add a GUI option to select what secure key storage backend to use when auto mounting volumes.

version 1.2.1
-- Maintanance release.
   -- FIX BUG: Dont generate an update warning prompt on startup when auto check for updates is set but the application
               is started while the system has no internet connection.
   -- FIX BUG: Dont auto delete mount folders when a volumes was unmounted outside of SiriKali.
   -- FIX BUG: Populate $PATH variable properly before calling backends since some backends fails without it.
   -- FIX BUG: The build process failed to build on Qt4

version 1.2.2
-- Add support for creating and unlocking ecryptfs volumes using ecryptfs-simple(https://github.com/mhogomchungu/ecryptfs-simple)

version 1.2.3
-- Make it possible to unlock a volume from favorite list without using key storage system.

version 1.2.4
-- Add OSX support.

version 1.2.5
-- Display backend error message to the user when SiriKali fails to figure out why requested operation failed.
-- Its now possible to view typed in password when creating/unlocking a volume.

version 1.2.6
-- Add a build time option(-DUSE_POLKIT=true) to support ecryptfs-simple backend build without suid bit set.
   This option will generate a polkit prompt on program start giving bad user experience. Enable it only if
   ecryptfs-simple backend is a necessary backend to have and it has to be installed without suid bit.
-- Default to not using a passward manager when unlocking volumes from favorites list.
-- Add an option to lock all unlocked volumes and quit the application on success.
-- Add a config option to run arbitrary command on successful mount attempt(arguments to the command will be
   cipher folder,plain folder and volume type).
-- All operations around locking and unlocking of volumes can now be done from CLI.
-- Add a plugin that allows generation of a key using a key+keyfile combination through a user configured external application.
   A user for example can set gpg as an external application so that they can extract a key from a gpg encrypted keyfile.
-- Add a config option to disable displaying of passwords.
-- Add ability to store passwords in OSX keychain.

version 1.2.7
-- Add ability to add mount options to a favorite entry.

version 1.2.8
-- Add a GUI way to set options when creating a securefs volume.
-- Add a GUI way to set options when creating a cryfs volume.
-- Agg a GUI way to display gocryptfs volume properties.
-- Better mount/unmount events monitoring on OSX.
-- Set it as a run time option(off by default) to support ecryptfs-simple backend that does not have suid bit set. A user
   will be asked to allow polkit support on first attempt.

version 1.2.9
-- Fix a crash on exit in OSX.
-- Show all crypto options when creating Cryfs volume.

version 1.3.0
-- Add "~/bin" and "~/.bin" paths to list of folders to search for executables.
-- Fix random crashes on OSX.

version 1.3.1
-- Add a config option on the menu list to set the app to start minimized.
-- Fix stability issues on MACOS.
