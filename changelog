version 1.0.0
-- Initial release.
-- Can create and unlock Cryfs Volumes.
-- Can create and unlock Encfs Volumes.
-- Can create and unlock Gocryptfs Volumes.
-- Can create and unlock Securefs Volumes.
-- Can save and retrieve volumes keys from KDE wallet,GNOME's libsecret and an internal
   secured storage system backed by libgcrypt.
-- Can save favorite volumes for easier access to frequently used volumes.
-- Can use keys derived from passphrases,keyfiles and a combination of a passphrase and a keyfile.
-- Can be build with Qt4(default) or with Qt5.
-- Can measure password strength when creating a new volume.
   The support is added using libpwquality project: https://fedorahosted.org/libpwquality/

-- Add ability to unmount all volumes at the same time(Menu->UnmountAll)
-- Add ability to generate mounting dialog with a single action(Menu->Favorites->Mount All)

-- Add French translations.

-- Add ability to auto unlock a volume from CLI.An example of how to do this is:

   sirikali -d /home/mtz/cryfs.volume -b "internal"

   The "-b" option gives a passphrase storage backend to use to retrieve the password to unlock
   the volume. Currently,only 3 backends are supported:
   1. "internal" backend is always there and its backed by libgcrypt.
   2. "kwallet" is backed by KDE wallet is a compile time dependency of the project.
   3. "gnomewallet" is backed by GNOME's libsecret and is a compile time dependency of the project.

   Set the backend to use a blank passphrase(not recommended) if you want to be able to unlock
   your volumes without being prompt for a backend password.

-- Add support for unlocking volumes using an external config file.
-- Add a GUI ability to show cryfs file system space utilization.
-- Add a menu entry to set default mount point path prefix.
-- Add a convenient "HMAC+KeyFile" option to use a keyfile with an empty passphrase
   as a volume password. "Key+KeyFile" option is to be used if volume passphrase is to be a combination
   of a password and a keyfile. Both of these two options are better than using a "KeyFile" option
   because keyfiles will most likely be trancated on the first new line character encountered and al the
   contents of the keyfile may not be used leading to weak passphrase.

version 1.1.0
-- Add ability to automount favorites volumes on program start up time.
-- Add ability to automount favorites volumes when they become available ie,when the files systems the volume
   resides in is mounted.

version 1.2.0
-- Add ability to add a favorite volume with mount options(external config file path,idle timeout,auto mount).
-- Add a GUI option to select what secure key storage backend to use when auto mounting volumes.
